## Review checklist (per PR)

- [ ] Correctness: does it do what the linked WBS item says?
- [ ] Tests: do new paths have tests? coverage ≥95%?
- [ ] Security: no secrets/PII persisted; untrusted packs sandboxed; fail-closed on tamper
- [ ] Determinism: results reproduce (pins + manifest); no silent pin change
- [ ] Honesty: misses present; no green without efficacy; `mock` never publishes
- [ ] Lint/types: ruff zero; mypy strict clean
- [ ] Docs: requirement→test mapping updated ([PRD 12](../../prd/12-traceability.md)); traceability + WBS checkpoint
- [ ] Non-goals: no detection claims, no enforcement, no novel-capability drift ([PRD 14](../../prd/14-non-goals.md))

## Milestone closure checklist (per milestone)

- [ ] Every work item implemented (no partials); test-first where the item is a behavior
- [ ] Milestone gates run **once at end**: full suite · coverage ≥95% · `ruff` · `mypy --strict`
- [ ] Committed · pushed · tracking issue closed (or commented)
- [ ] Design/reference docs updated + linked from the WBS
- [ ] Checkpoint appended to the [WBS index](wbs-v0.1.0-index.md) Progress section (commit refs + gate result)
